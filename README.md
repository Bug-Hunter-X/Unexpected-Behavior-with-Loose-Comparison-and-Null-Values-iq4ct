This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose comparison with null values and provides a clear solution using strict equality. Loose comparison (==) can lead to unexpected results when comparing against null, particularly when dealing with falsy values like 0, "", or false. The solution presented shows how to explicitly check for null using the strict equality operator (===) to avoid these issues.
